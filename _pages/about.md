Tao Feng earned his PhD in 2018 from the UCAS (University of Chinese Academy of Sciences) for the Plant Systematics and Evolution, with a focus on the Himalayan alpine flora. He is currently a Marie-Curie fellow in the Department of Plant Sciences at Cambridge University, where he works on plant adaptation to high-altitude environment. His broader work moves across plant taxonomy, evolutionary biology, genomics, and ecology to explore the diversity and evolution of Himalayan alpine plants.

As an academic researcher, he examines long-term evolutionary dynamics to better understand how gene, genome and trait evolve. As a bioinformatian, he develops tools to decipher complex genomes, with a focus on Asteraceae. Drawn to structure and spatial clarity, his work reveals the underlying patterns in plant diversity and adaptation.
